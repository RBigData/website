	<p>For users who only wish to use Rstudio, you will not need to worry about setting up an RSA key pair during this step. 
	<br/>Select "Proceed without a key pair", click the checkbox, and then click "Launch Instances".
	</p>

	<p>Check the launch log of your instances if you wish. When you are finished, click "View Instances".</p>

</li>
<li>
	<p>Select the running instance which we have created. In the bottom portion of the screen, additional details are displayed.
	<br/>Copy the "Public DNS" field. We will need this in the next step to access the Rstudio web interface.</p>

<li>
	<p>Paste the "Public DNS" from the previous step into the web browser URL area. 
	<br/>If your instance is currently running, then you should be greeted with the Rstudio login page.
	<br/>Enter "rstudio" for both the username and password to login as the "rstudio" user.
