  <h2> JSM 2017 Continuing Education Course:
    <br>
    "Essentials of High Performance and Parallel Statistical Computing with R"
    <br>
    August 1, 2017, Baltimore, MD, USA
  </h2>
  <br>
  Thank you for enrolling in the "Essentials of High Performance and
  Parallel Staitstical Computing in R" Pofessional Development
  Continuing Education Course. We look forward to teaching the course.
  <br><br>
  To prepare your laptop for running some of the class
  scripts, see
  <a href="http://pbdr.org/packages.html#installation">Installation
    Instructions</a>.  Either the Docker or native install will work.
  <br><br>
  For the Docker install, you first need Docker itself and then follow
  the Workshop/Tutorial section of the installation instructions. The
  Docker install includes OpenBLAS and RStudio Server.
  The native install is usually more involved but can provide
  easier interaction with other tools on your laptop.
  <br><br>
  The course includes presentation components and demonstration
  components. You can gain a lot of understanding from just listening to
  the course presentation and demonstartions but a deeper understanding
  is possible if you run some of the scripts (link below) on your laptop
  either during class or later on a system larger than your laptop.
  <br><br>
  While many of the techniques demonstrated are capable of efficiently
  using the largest available systems (e.g. Titan, the largest system in
  the US) they run and usually provide speedup benefits even on a
  laptop. Initial parallel code development can normally be done on a
  laptop.
  <br><br>
  We look forward to teaching the course!
