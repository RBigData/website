# Statistical Analysis of Big Data Using R

Thank you for enrolling in the Global Initiative on Academic Network 
(GIAN) course on "Statistical Analysis of Big Data Using R." We look forward to teaching the course.

## Background

* **Date:** December 3-8, 2018
* **Location:** Mangalore University, Department of Statistics, Mangalagangothri, Karnataka â€“ 574199
* **Presenters:** Professor George Ostrouchov, University of Tennessee and Oak Ridge National Laboratory  
    **\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ ** Professor Nagaraj Neerchal, University of Maryland Baltimore County
* **Host:** Professor Ismail B, Mangalore University


## Prerequisites 

The course includes presentation and demonstration components in the morning and hands-on components in the afternoon. You can gain a lot of understanding from just listening to the course presentation and demonstrations but a deeper understanding is possible if you run some of the scripts on your laptop in the afternoon hands-on sessions or at some later time, possibly on a system larger than your laptop.

**We highly recommend doing your installations before getting to the course** due to the size of the downloads and limited bandwidth available at the venue. There are two ways to run the scripts from the course: in a native installation (easy for the basics - R and RStudio - but difficult for high performance and parallel - OpenBLAS, Cygwin, MPI, pbdR) or you can use our Docker containers, which give you all that you need with relative ease.

* Docker instructions (Easier)
    - Install Docker
        - Windows: [Docker](https://download.docker.com/win/stable/Docker%20for%20Windows%20Installer.exe) for Windows 64 Bit 10 Pro Enterprise and Education. Read [What to know before you install](https://docs.docker.com/v17.09/docker-for-windows/install/#what-to-know-before-you-install). If your system does not meet the requirements to run Docker for Windows, you can install [Docker Toolbox](https://docs.docker.com/v17.09/toolbox/overview/).
        - Mac: [Docker for Mac](https://store.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-mac)
        - Unix: [Docker for various flavors of Unix](https://store.docker.com/search?type=edition&offering=community)
     - Install Docker containers in a terminal window with commands (on Windows in a Docker Quickstart Terminal): 
         - `docker pull rbigdata/pbdr-workshop:pbdr`
         - `docker pull rbigdata/pbdr-workshop:rstudio`
* Native installations (First two are easy but rest are more difficult)
    - Install [R](https://cloud.r-project.org/)
    - Install [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)
    - Install [OpenBLAS](https://www.openblas.net/)
    - Install [OpenMPI](https://www.open-mpi.org/software/ompi/v4.0/)
        - Windows users need Cygwin OpenMPI version and [Cygwin](http://www.cygwin.com/) itself.

See you in Mangalore!

## Materials

* We will post slides and materials for hands-on sessions here soon.

Updated slides and/or scripts will also be posted after completion of the course, as needed.
