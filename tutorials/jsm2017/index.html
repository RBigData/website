<p>Thank you for enrolling in the &quot;Essentials of High Performance and Parallel Statistical Computing in R&quot; Professional Development Continuing Education Course. We look forward to teaching the course.</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Date:</strong> August 1, 2017</li>
<li><strong>Location:</strong> Baltimore, MD, USA</li>
<li><strong>Presenters:</strong> George Ostrouchov and Wei-Chen Chen</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="materials">Materials</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Slides:</strong> [ <a href="pbdR_twoup.pdf">pdf</a> ]</li>
<li><strong>Scripts:</strong> [ <a href="http://RBigData.github.io/jsm2017/scripts.zip?raw=true">zip</a> ]</li>
</ul>
<p>Updated slides and/or scripts will be posted after completion of the course, as needed.</p>
<h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>
<p>The course includes presentation components and demonstration components. You can gain a lot of understanding from just listening to the course presentation and demonstrations but a deeper understanding is possible if you run some of the scripts on your laptop either during class or later on a system larger than your laptop.</p>
<p>In order to run the scripts, you will need to have R, MPI, and several R packages installed. You can install the &quot;native&quot; versions or, more conveniently, install a docker container we have prepared. We generally recommend going with Docker for the sake of ease.</p>
<ul>
<li>Docker instructions [ <a href="https://github.com/RBigData/installation-instructions/raw/master/build/docker.pdf">pdf</a> | <a href="https://rawgit.com/wrathematics/installation-instructions/master/build/docker.html">html</a> ]
<ul>
<li>Install docker, then follow the &quot;Workshop/Tutorial&quot; section under pbdR Docker Builds</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Native instructions [ <a href="https://github.com/RBigData/installation-instructions/raw/master/build/native.pdf">pdf</a> | <a href="https://rawgit.com/wrathematics/installation-instructions/master/build/native.html">html</a> ]
<ul>
<li>Install R, MPI, and the required packages. RStudio is optional, but recommended.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>While many of the techniques demonstrated are capable of efficiently using the largest available systems (e.g. Titan, the largest system in the US) they run and usually provide speedup benefits even on a laptop. Initial parallel code development can normally be done on a laptop.</p>
<p>See you in Baltimore!</p>
